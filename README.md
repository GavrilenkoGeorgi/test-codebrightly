#### Issues
  Used one variable font (Avenir Next Variable)
  instead of regular (Sofia Pro), because
  of many variations in font weight on the page.
  Font download size decreased from ~600KB to 87KB.

  Router uses history mode, so refreshing the page
  will navigate you to index.html
  History mode is used to navigate to anchor
  on the main page
