#### Issues
  Used one variable font (Avenir Next Variable)
  instead of regular (Sofia Pro), due to
  many variations of font weight on the page.
  Font download size decreased from ~600KB to 87KB.

  SVG icons are not really Svg icons, just an embedded
  image in Base64. Taken from .psd layout file provided.
